# hello-world
my first repository
Hello, my name is Matthew Townsend.I have gone down the rabbit hole into the coding world! I am a husband and father and I am looking for a better way to live. I have been a mechanic, a carpenter, a taxi/Uber driver, and a medical cannabis caregiver. I am learning coding on freecodecamp.org, which is a wonderful resource for those wanting to get into the programming world, but, do not have a lot of money for education. I hope to be able to get good enough to help in the blockchain ecosystem. I have a lot of hard work ahead, but, I enjoy the challenges that I will face.
